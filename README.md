# Audio Visualizer Soldering Kit

## Overview
The Audio Visualizer Soldering Kit uses an LM3914 to show the loudness of your music. Audio signals are put in through a 3.5mm audio port, and can then be passed through the other port. A switch on the board allows you to choose which channel is shown. The LM3914 will light up 10 LEDs to correspond with the voltage of the audio signal. 

In its current configuration it does work, but only with very loud noises. I need to do a re-design of this board to make it work better.
